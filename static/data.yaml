        # Project Description:
        ======================<br><br>

        - Detects theft by stepping on a tile
        - Camera points to the tile
        - Captures and uploads picture to server
        - Website displays picture with timestamp

        <br>
        <br>

        # Fast Concept Catchup:
        ======================<br><br>

        - when system is ON
        - where ever any theft steps on the tile 
        - then the camera will point to that tile 
        - and then capture the picture of the theft 
        - and uploads it to the server
        - the website will show the picture of the theft with timestamp

        # Problem Statement:
        =====================<br>
        Theft detection is crucial for securing premises, but conventional systems often lack real-time responsiveness and accurate targeting. Many systems are unable to precisely capture evidence when a theft occurs, leading to inadequate security measures. This project addresses the need for a responsive and accurate theft detection system that not only identifies the exact location of the theft but also captures and uploads images in real time, enhancing overall security and providing reliable evidence for authorities.

        # Problem Statement:
        =====================<br>
        Practicing organ stitching in robotic surgery requires precise control and feedback to simulate real surgical conditions. Traditional methods may lack the accuracy and responsiveness needed for effective training. This project aims to provide a realistic practice environment by allowing users to control a robotic arm to stitch organs, enhancing their skills and confidence. The system tracks practice trials, providing valuable feedback for continuous improvement, thereby addressing the need for advanced surgical training tools.
